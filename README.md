-  Hi, I’m @NikandrTheGreat. Nikandr isn't my real name, it is only an alias. 
-  I’m interested in learning C++ and documenting my progress.
-  I’m currently learning C++ and GDscript. I will be posting a few projects while I am learning.
-  My goal is to become good at graphic programming with OpenGL and possibly Vulkan. I am going to start out with something less complicated like SFML just to get a feel of C++ and build a bit of knowledge on graphics.
